## Scope
#### The goal of this project was to utilize APIs to pull ticker data from stocks, bonds, and cryptos to so we could analyze their performance over the last thousand trading days. After pulling the data from the APIs, it would then be cleaned up using pandas to only keep track of the 'close' data and then after stored using SQL. From there the data can then be pulled to analyze the returns over the past thousand trading days.


#### Our first step was to creeate a pseudo-code
> 1. Import libraries
> 2. Load APIs
>>
> 3. Integrate SQL
> 4.
